# Expense Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Expense Management System with all the features requested in the detailed requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication (Sign-in/Sign-up)
- **Sign-up Page**: Implemented with fields for Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, and Country selection dropdown to set the company's base currency. Creates an Admin user on sign-up.
- **Sign-in Page**: Implemented with Email, Password fields, and Login button. Includes "Don't have an account? Signup" link.
- **Forgot Password**: Implemented with a "Forgot password?" link that navigates to a password reset page.

### 2. Admin View: User Management (Create Users)
- **User Creation**: Panel to create new users with fields for User, Email, Role (Manager, Employee), and Manager (dynamic searchable dropdown/lookup).
- **Manager Field Logic**: Dynamic searchable dropdown/lookup with mechanism to create a new user on the fly if a name is entered and no user is found.
- **Initial Password**: "Send password" button that generates a random unique password and sends it to the user's email.
- **User Roles**: Support for different roles: Admin, Manager, and Employee.

### 3. Admin View: Approval Rules Configuration
- **Rule Overview**: Interface to define and view approval rules with Description field.
- **Manager as Approver**: Checkbox "Is manager an approver?" that sends the expense request to the employee's manager first.
- **Approver List**: List of approvers with fields for Approver, Required (checkbox), and ability to set approval Sequence.
- **Sequence Logic**: Setting for "Approvers Sequence" - if ticked, sequence matters; if not ticked, request goes to all approvers at the same time.
- **Minimum Approval Percentage**: Field for "Minimum Approval percentage" to specify required percentage of approvals.

### 4. Employee's View: Expense Submission
- **Expense Creation**: "New" section with "Attach Receipt" button.
- **OCR Functionality**: Upload receipt or take photo with OCR to automatically populate expense details.
- **Expense Fields**: Fields include Description, Category, Total amount (in currency spent), Expense Date, Paid by (Employee/Company), and Remarks.
- **Currency Handling**: Employee can submit expense in any currency.
- **Submission Status**: Expense submitted via "Submit" button becomes read-only, submit button invisible, and state changes to "pending approval".

### 5. Employee's View: Expense History/Status
- **Expense List**: Dashboard listing expenses with columns for Employee, Description, Date, Category, Paid By, Amount, and Status.
- **Expense States**: Categorized into states: To submit (Draft), Waiting approval (Submitted), and Approved.
- **To Submit Logic**: Expenses in draft state not yet submitted.
- **Waiting Approval Logic**: Expenses submitted but not yet approved by matching approval rules.
- **Approval Log**: Log history visible once expense is submitted, detailing which user approved/rejected the request and at what time.

### 6. Manager's View: Approval Dashboard
- **Request List**: Dashboard of Approvals to review with columns for Approval Subject, Request Owner, Category, Request Status, and Total amount (in company's currency).
- **Currency Conversion**: Total amount auto-converted to company's base currency using real-time currency conversion rates.
- **Approval Actions**: Each request has Approve (green button) and Reject (red button) actions.
- **Action State Change**: Once manager approves/rejects expense, record becomes read-only, Request Status field is set, and action buttons become invisible.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **State Management**: Context API for global state
- **Styling**: CSS Modules and modern CSS features
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and production builds
